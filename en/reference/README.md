# Pagsmile API

  We offer you a robust and flexible API, you can integrate in the way that best suits your business.


# What is it?

  It is an Application Programming Interface that allows you to exchange information with our platform.

# How it works?

  You can request information, for example about a payment, using HTTPS (similar to a browser). We provide RESTful-style interfaces and our own payment page, eliminating the need for redevelopment.
